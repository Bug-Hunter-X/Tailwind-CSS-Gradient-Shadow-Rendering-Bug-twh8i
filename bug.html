```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS classes for a gradient background.  However, if the `shadow-lg` class is applied *after* the gradient, it will render incorrectly in some browsers or configurations, with the shadow appearing behind the gradient instead of on top.

This is often due to the stacking context in CSS. The gradient creates its own stacking context, causing the shadow to be rendered behind it.
