```html
<div class="shadow-lg bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
By moving `shadow-lg` before the gradient classes, the shadow is correctly rendered on top of the gradient. This ensures that the visual appearance is correct across different browsers and configurations.
